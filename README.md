# covid19_russia_mapping
##This project aimed at describing outcomes of COVID-19 epidemics in Russia.
##We utilize demographic data and estimates for mortality and hospitalization rates, as well as available data on invasive ##mechanical ventilation units per region to estimate the most vulnerable ones.

The provided estimates have some caveats:
1. We expect the uniform attack  rate for different age groups
2. We estimate mortality by infection fatality ratio (IFR) provided by Verity et al., 2020. This is probably an underestimation
3. We lack data on IMV units in some regions
4. We expect about 60% of population to get affected by COVID-19 if no measures will be applied


All the code and neccessary data is provided in the repository
